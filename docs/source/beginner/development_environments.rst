Software development environments
=================================
This section describes how you can setup your software development environment. This includes setting up a directory structure to organise the storage of your software projects. The next step involves setting up an `integrated development environment (IDE) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment>`_. This is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.

Below are a list of cross-platform IDE's that you can use for software development. Cross-platform IDE's will work across Linux, Mac, and Windows.

.. note::
  As part of best practices in software development, it is important that your software environment is replicable. To achieve this, it is recommended to use either a container-based IDE or an online-based IDE.
