Programming languages
=====================

This section describes commonly used programming languages used in research projects.

Python
======
The python programming language is recommended for research projects.

Learning python
---------------
Here are a few tools/resources that can help you learn the python programming language:

- `Pycharm Edu <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/>`_ includes interactive tutorials on how to program with python.
- `CodeCombat <https://codecombat.com>`_ helps you learn coding with python while playing a real game (sign up as a student. Select ‘individual account’ when prompted).

Python style guide
------------------
All code must follow an official style guide to ensure the code can be easily shared and understood by others.
We recommend using `google coding style <http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html>`_ that is based on PEP8.
See `Doc string conventions (PEP257) <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_ for information about how to write docstrings.

Python virtual environments
---------------------------

- `Data camp tutorial <https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/virtual-environment-in-python>`_
- `Real Python tutorial <https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer>`_

Matlab
======

.. warning::
   We do not recommend the use of Matlab for creating new code (closed-source/limited toolbox licenses etc, collaborators need to have licenses, uses proprietary export formats e.g. .mat which is built around existing standard formats hdf5, making collaboration/transfer of data between codes difficult etc).

   We recommend open-source programming languages such as python (you can load .mat files with a range of libraries such as readmat is recommended).

   The following guides are provided for helping maintain legacy codes.

Matlab style guide
------------------
In the event that you need to contribute to existing matlab code. Please use the following `style guide <https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46056-matlab-style-guidelines-2-0>`_.
