Version control
===============

Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code (similar to tracking changes in a Microsoft Word document). Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members :cite:`atlassian_what_is_version_control`.

Git is a version control system that is used to track changes that are made to a file or project. It was made by Linus Trovalds (the creator of the Linux operating system).

GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, on the other hand, are open-source cloud-based collaboration platforms that allow developers to easily share software, manage, and collaborate on different projects.
